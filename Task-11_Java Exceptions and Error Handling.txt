Java Exceptions and Error Handling


Q1. Access Modifier


1. Private
Using a private access modifier in attributes and methods we can access only inside the class. 
2. Default
-Using the default access modifier in class then we can access the classes in the same package only.
-For the default access modifier, we no need to specify the access modifier.
-Using the default access modifier in attributes and methods we can access in the same package only.
3. Protected
Protected access modifier, using extends keyword we can access in the same package and subclasses.
4. Public
Using a public access modifier, we can access all classes.


Q2. Difference between Exception and Error


Exception:
* An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
* Exceptions are typically caused by the program itself and can be handled by the program.
* They are often recoverable and don't necessarily lead to termination of the program.
* Examples of exceptions include trying to access a file that doesn't exist, attempting to divide by zero, or trying to access an invalid memory location.
* Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors.


Error:
* An error, on the other hand, is typically a problem that occurs outside of the control of the program itself.
* Errors are often more serious and severe than exceptions and may indicate critical failures in the system or environment.
* They are usually not recoverable and can lead to termination of the program.
* Examples of errors include hardware malfunctions, out-of-memory conditions, stack overflow, or running out of system resources.


Q3. Difference between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception


 Checked Exception
* Checked exceptions occur at compile time.
* The compiler checks a checked exception.
* Checked exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation.
* Checked exceptions are the sub-class of the exception class.
* Examples of Checked exceptions: File Not Found Exception, Class Not Found Exception

 Unchecked Exception
* Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime. ,,,m
* The compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
* Unchecked exceptions cannot be a catch or handle at the time of compilation, because they get generated by the mistakes in the program.
* Unchecked exceptions are runtime exceptions and hence are not a part of the Exception class.
* Examples of Unchecked Exceptions: No Such Element Exception, Arithmetic Exception, Array Index Out of Bounds Exception
